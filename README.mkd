# Pynclose
Python wrapper around the [In-Close algorithm implementation by Simon Andrews](https://sourceforge.net/projects/inclose/), Sheffield Hallam University, UK, Conceptual Structures Research Group.


## In-Close sources
Version of 18/07/2017 retrieved from
[the project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/inclose/),
and slightly changed to remove non-necessary parts (see 468fad66 and 04c00c47).

### Features
- [X] make the sources really wrappable and usable as a lib, notability by crushing the main into a function with lots of parameters instead of waiting for them in the standard input.
- [ ] fix the C global variable bug, as found by [run_test_dir/test_reusability_of_search.py](run_test_dir/test_reusability_of_search.py)
- [ ] Unit tests.
- [ ] Better file path management (python side, probably).
- [ ] Packaging is currently a mess ; notabily becauses C package is not properly integrated into the package itself. Compilation may or may not be working when installing from pypi.
